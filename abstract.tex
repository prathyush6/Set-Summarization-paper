\textbf{Abstract:}~
 The problem of concisely summarizing datasets arises in many
applications including databases, computational biology, epidemiology
and business. One version of this problem where the goal is to
express a given target set  as the union of a small collection of
given sets has been studied in the literature.  We consider an
extension of the problem where the goal is to express a target set
as the set difference between the unions of two collections of sets.
We observe that allowing the difference operator can significantly
reduce the cost of summarization. Since the problem is NP-hard, we
develop approximation algorithms provable performance guarantees
for the general problem and some restricted versions. Our main
results exploit the fact that problem corresponds to minimizing a
submodular objective function subject to a constraint on another
submodular function. We also carry out an experimental evaluation
of the performance of our algorithms using public domain datasets.
