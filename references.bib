  Abstract                 = {<sec> <title>Background</title> <p>Epidemiologists and
 ecologists often collect data in the field and, on
 returning to their laboratory, enter their data into a
 database for further analysis. The recent introduction of
 mobile phones that utilise the open source Android
 operating system, and which include (among other features)
 both GPS and Google Maps, provide new opportunities for
 developing mobile phone applications, which in conjunction
 with web applications, allow two-way communication between
 field workers and their project databases.</p> </sec><sec>
 <title>Methodology</title> <p>Here we describe a generic
 framework, consisting of mobile phone software, EpiCollect,
 and a web application located within <ext-link
 xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
 ext-link-type="uri"
 xlink:href="http://www.spatialepidemiology.net"
 xlink:type="simple">www.spatialepidemiology.net</ext-link>.
 Data collected by multiple field workers can be submitted
 by phone, together with GPS data, to a common web database
 and can be displayed and analysed, along with previously
 collected data, using Google Maps (or Google Earth).
 Similarly, data from the web database can be requested and
 displayed on the mobile phone, again using Google Maps.
 Data filtering options allow the display of data submitted
 by the individual field workers or, for example, those data
 within certain values of a measured variable or a time
 period.</p> </sec><sec> <title>Conclusions</title> <p>Data
 collection frameworks utilising mobile phones with data
 submission to and from central databases are widely
 applicable and can give a field worker similar display and
 analysis tools on their mobile phone that they would have
 if viewing the data in their laboratory via the web. We
 demonstrate their utility for epidemiological data
 collection and display, and briefly discuss their
 application in ecological and community data collection.
 Furthermore, such frameworks offer great potential for
 recruiting citizen scientists to contribute data easily
 to central databases through their mobile phone.</p>

  Abstract                 = {The rising popularity of the sensor-equipped smartphone is
 changing the possible scale and scope of human activity
 inference. The diversity in user population seen in large
 user bases can overwhelm conventional one-size-fits-all
 classication approaches. Although personalized models are
 better able to handle population diversity, they often
 require increased effort from the end user during training
 and are computationally expensive. In this paper, we
 propose an activity classification framework that is
 scalable and can tractably handle an increasing number of
 users. Scalability is achieved by maintaining distinct
 groups of similar users during the training process, which
 makes it possible to account for the differences between
 users without resorting to training individualized
 classifiers. The proposed framework keeps user burden low
 by leveraging crowd-sourced data labels, where simple
 natural language processing techniques in combination with
 multiinstance learning are used to handle labeling errors
 introduced by low-commitment everyday users. Experiment
 results on a large public dataset demonstrate that the
 framework can cope with population diversity irrespective
 of population size.},

  Abstract                 = {The k-core is commonly used as a measure of importance and
 well connectedness for nodes in diverse applications in
 social networks and bioinformatics. Since network data is
 commonly noisy and incomplete, a fundamental issue is to
 understand how robust the core decomposition is to noise.
 Further, in many settings, such as online social media
 networks, usually only a sample of the network is
 available. Therefore, a related question is: how robust is
 the top core set under such sampling?

 We find that, in general, the top core is quite sensitive
 to both noise and sampling; we quantify this in terms of
 the Jaccard similarity of the set of top core nodes between
 the original and perturbed/sampled graphs. Most
 importantly, we find that the overlap with the top core set
 varies non-monotonically with the extent of
 perturbations/sampling. We explain some of these empirical
 observations by rigorous analysis in simple network models.
 Our work has important implications for the use of the core
 decomposition and nodes in the top cores in network
 analysis applications, and suggests the need for a more
 careful characterization of the missing data and
 sensitivity to it.},

  Abstract                 = {An Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scope emerged in West
 Africa in December 2013 and presently continues unabated in
 the countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Ebola
 is not new to Africa, and outbreaks have been confirmed as
 far back as 1976. The current West African Ebola outbreak
 is the largest ever recorded and differs dramatically from
 prior outbreaks in its duration, number of people affected,
 and geographic extent. The emergence of this deadly disease
 in West Africa invites many questions, foremost among
 these: why now, and why in West Africa? Here, we review the
 sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that
 might have influenced the emergence of Ebola in this region
 of Africa and its spread throughout the region. Containment
 of the West African Ebola outbreak is the most pressing,
 immediate need. A comprehensive assessment of the drivers
 of Ebola emergence and sustained human-to-human
 transmission is also needed in order to prepare other
 countries for importation or emergence of this disease.
 Such assessment includes identification of country-level
 protocols and interagency policies for outbreak detection
 and rapid response, increased understanding of cultural and
 traditional risk factors within and between nations,
 delivery of culturally embedded public health education,
 and regional coordination and collaboration, particularly
 with governments and health ministries throughout Africa.
 Public health education is also urgently needed in
 countries outside of Africa in order to ensure that risk is
 properly understood and public concerns do not escalate
 unnecessarily. To prevent future outbreaks, coordinated,
 multiscale, early warning systems should be developed that
 make full use of these integrated assessments, partner with
 local communities in high-risk areas, and provide clearly
 defined response recommendations specific to the needs of
 each community.},

  Abstract                 = {Wildlife species are identified as an important source of
 emerging zoonotic disease. Accordingly, public health
 programs have attempted to expand in scope to include a
 greater focus on wildlife and its role in zoonotic disease
 outbreaks. Zoonotic disease transmission dynamics involving
 wildlife are complex and nonlinear, presenting a number of
 challenges. First, empirical characterization of wildlife
 host species and pathogen systems are often lacking, and
 insight into one system may have little application to
 another involving the same host species and pathogen.
 Pathogen transmission characterization is difficult due to
 the changing nature of population size and density
 associated with wildlife hosts. Infectious disease itself
 may influence wildlife population demographics through
 compensatory responses that may evolve, such as decreased
 age to reproduction. Furthermore, wildlife reservoir
 dynamics can be complex, involving various host species and
 populations that may vary in their contribution to pathogen
 transmission and persistence over space and time.
 Mathematical models can provide an important tool to engage
 these complex systems, and there is an urgent need for
 increased computational focus on the coupled dynamics that
 underlie pathogen spillover at the human-wildlife
 interface. Often, however, scientists conducting empirical
 studies on emerging zoonotic disease do not have the
 necessary skill base to choose, develop, and apply models
 to evaluate these complex systems. How do modeling
 frameworks differ and what considerations are important
 when applying modeling tools to the study of zoonotic
 disease? Using zoonotic disease examples, we provide an
 overview of several common approaches and general
 considerations important in the modeling of
 wildlife-associated zoonoses.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we argue that the predominant models of
 Situation Awareness (SA) are inadequate for the study of
 systems operated by teams. The reason for this is that
 these models are based on mentalistic assumptions focusing
 almost exclusively on individuals. We suggest that, to
 study the control of dynamic systems, it is necessary to
 shift the unit of analysis from the individual to the whole
 cognitive system comprising a team of people as well as the
 artefacts which they use. Thus, our vantage point is the
 theoretical framework of distributed cognition. Through two
 field studies we try to demonstrate how team situation
 awareness is actively constructed via the communicative
 practices which the team uses in its work.},

  Abstract                 = { <p>After the emergence of the H1N1 influenza in 2009,
 some countries responded with travel-related controls
 during the early stage of the outbreak in an attempt to
 contain or slow down its international spread. These
 controls along with self-imposed travel limitations
 contributed to a decline of about 40% in international air
 traffic to/from Mexico following the international alert.
 However, no containment was achieved by such restrictions
 and the virus was able to reach pandemic proportions in a
 short time. When gauging the value and efficacy of mobility
 and travel restrictions it is crucial to rely on epidemic
 models that integrate the wide range of features
 characterizing human mobility and the many options
 available to public health organizations for responding to
 a pandemic. Here we present a comprehensive computational
 and theoretical study of the role of travel restrictions in
 halting and delaying pandemics by using a model that
 explicitly integrates air travel and short-range mobility
 data with high-resolution demographic data across the world
 and that is validated by the accumulation of data from the
 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We explore alternative scenarios for
 the 2009 H1N1 pandemic by assessing the potential impact of
 mobility restrictions that vary with respect to their
 magnitude and their position in the pandemic timeline. We
 provide a quantitative discussion of the delay obtained by
 different mobility restrictions and the likelihood of
 containing outbreaks of infectious diseases at their
 source, confirming the limited value and feasibility of
 international travel restrictions. These results are
 rationalized in the theoretical framework characterizing
 the invasion dynamics of the epidemics at the
 metapopulation level.</p> },

  Abstract                 = {Flourishing economy, rapid industrialization and
 increasing trend of motorization have been shaping
 societies in the developing countries like India in an
 unprecedented manner. Infrastructure backlog amid such
 rapid growth in all imaginable directions has heavily
 exacerbated the urban transport crisis in these countries
 by alarming increase in vehicular travel demand, road
 fatalities, and environmental pollution. To address urban
 transport challenges, the necessary development and
 implementation of effective transport planning and policies
 have generally lagged in the developing countries compared
 to that seen in the developed countries due to several
 constraints including resource constraints, knowledge
 constraints, institutional constraints and so on. However,
 in the recent past, with the rapid development seen by
 several emerging economies and the explosive growth in
 transportation infrastructure investment, there is a
 growing interest in the development and implementation of
 advanced travel demand modeling systems in developing
 countries. But lack of necessary research and exploration
 of travel behavior in a developing country context has left
 very limited knowledge for us to understand the extent of
 applicability of these advanced theories and methodologies
 in a different sociocultural perspective. Assessing the
 practical relevance of the subject, this research adopts a
 comprehensive approach to explore the activity engagement
 pattern and time use behavior from a developing country
 standpoint. To accomplish this goal, a series of empirical
 and analytical studies are performed on a household travel
 survey data set available from Thane Metropolitan Area in
 India. The study also introduces new concepts and
 facilitates enhancements of existing modeling methodologies
 in the field of travel behavior and time use research. The
 study results provide very insightful findings and
 plausible interpretations consistent with a developing
 country perspective recognizing a wide spectrum of
 differences and similarities in activity patterns and time
 use behavior between a developed and a developing country.
 Specified model structures are meaningfully able to
 incorporate various socio-cultural and institutional
 constraints and reflected sensitivity to the behavioral
 variability between the contexts suggesting that advanced
 analytical techniques may be satisfactorily applied on the
 data set from developing countries which may contribute
 important ingredients in the development of advanced
 activity-based model system in the countries like India.},

 co-evolution between socio-technical networks, individual
 behaviors and contagion processes on these networks. We use
 epidemics in human population as an exemplar of this
 phenomenon. The methods consist of developing synthetic yet
 realistic national-scale networks using a first principles
 approach. Unlike simple random graph techniques, these
 methods use real world data sources and combine them with
 behavioral and social theories to synthesize networks.
 Individual-based models of disease progression and
 transmission are then used to model the contagion process.
 Finally, models of individual behaviors are composed with
 disease progression models to develop a realistic
 representation of the complex system in which individual
 behaviors and the social network adapt to the contagion.
 These ideas are embodied within a general purpose modeling
 environment called Simdemics. Simdemics is designed
 specifically to be scalable to networks with 300 million
 agents - the underlying algorithms and methods in Simdemics
 are all high-performance computing oriented methods. New
 advances in network science, machine learning, high
 performance computing, data mining and behavioral modeling
 were necessary to develop Simdemics.

 Simdemics is combined with two other environments:
 Simfrastructure and Didactic to form an integrated
 cyber-environment. The integrated cyber-environment
 provides the end-user flexible and seamless Internet based
 access to the high-performance computing models represented
 in Simdemics. Service-oriented architectures plays critical
 role in delivering the desired services to the end user.
 Simdemics and the integrated cyber-environment have been
 used in over a dozen user defined case studies. These case
 studies were done to support specific policy questions that
 arose in the context of planning and responding in the
 event of pandemics (e.g. H1N1, avian influenza) or other
 human initiated bio-terrorism events. These studies played
 a crucial role in the continual development and improvement
 of the cyber-environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Human behavior, social networks, and the civil
 infrastructures are closely intertwined. Understanding
 their co-evolution is critical for designing public
 policies and decision support for disaster planning. For
 example, human behaviors and day to day activities of
 individuals create dense social interactions that are
 characteristic of modern urban societies. These dense
 social networks provide a perfect fabric for fast,
 uncontrolled disease propagation. Conversely, people's
 behavior in response to public policies and their
 perception of how the crisis is unfolding as a result of
 disease outbreak can dramatically alter the normally stable
 social interactions. Effective planning and response
 strategies must take these complicated interactions into
 account. In this chapter, we describe a computer simulation
 based approach to study these issues using public health
 and computational epidemiology as an illustrative example.
 We also formulate game-theoretic and stochastic
 optimization problems that capture many of the problems
 that we study empirically.},

  Abstract                 = {Graph sparsification is the approximation of an arbitrary
 graph by a sparse graph.

 We explain what it means for one graph to be a spectral
 approximation of another and review the development of
 algorithms for spectral sparsification. In addition to
 being an interesting concept, spectral sparsification has
 been an important tool in the design of nearly linear-time
 algorithms for solving systems of linear equations in
 symmetric, diagonally dominant matrices. The fast solution
 of these linear systems has already led to breakthrough
 results in combinatorial optimization, including a faster
 algorithm for finding approximate maximum flows and minimum
 cuts in an undirected network.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to their cheap development costs and ease of
 deployment, surveys and questionnaires are useful tools for
 gathering information about the activity patterns of a
 large group and can serve as a valuable supplement to
 tracking studies done with mobile devices. However in raw
 form, general survey data is not necessarily useful for
 answering predictive questions about the behavior of a
 large social system. In this paper, we describe a method
 for generating agent activity profiles from survey data for
 an agent-based model (ABM) of transportation patterns of
 47,000 students on a university campus. We compare the
 performance of our agent-based model against a Markov Chain
 Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation based directly on the
 distributions fitted from the survey data. A comparison of
 our simulation results against an independently collected
 dataset reveals that our ABM can be used to accurately
 forecast parking behavior over the semester and is
 significantly more accurate than the MCMC estimator.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Safe and effective vaccines could help to end the ongoing Ebola virus disease epidemic in parts of west Africa, and mitigate future outbreaks of the virus. We assess the statistical validity and power of randomised controlled trial (RCT) and stepped-wedge cluster trial (SWCT) designs in Sierra Leone, where the incidence of Ebola virus disease is spatiotemporally heterogeneous, and is decreasing rapidly.

METHODS:We projected district-level Ebola virus disease incidence for the next 6 months, using a stochastic model fitted to data from Sierra Leone. We then simulated RCT and SWCT designs in trial populations comprising geographically distinct clusters at high risk, taking into account realistic logistical constraints, and both individual-level and cluster-level variations in risk. We assessed false-positive rates and power for parametric and non-parametric analyses of simulated trial data, across a range of vaccine efficacies and trial start dates.

FINDINGS:For an SWCT, regional variation in Ebola virus disease incidence trends produced increased false-positive rates (up to 0{\textperiodcentered}15 at $\alpha$=0{\textperiodcentered}05) under standard statistical models, but not when analysed by a permutation test, whereas analyses of RCTs remained statistically valid under all models. With the assumption of a 6-month trial starting on Feb 18, 2015, we estimate the power to detect a 90% effective vaccine to be between 49% and 89% for an RCT, and between 6% and 26% for an SWCT, depending on the Ebola virus disease incidence within the trial population. We estimate that a 1-month delay in trial initiation will reduce the power of the RCT by 20% and that of the SWCT by 49%.

INTERPRETATION:Spatiotemporal variation in infection risk undermines the statistical power of the SWCT. This variation also undercuts the SWCT's expected ethical advantages over the RCT, because an RCT, but not an SWCT, can prioritise vaccination of high-risk clusters.

  Abstract                 = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally
 depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that
 this is because different representations can entangle and
 hide more or less the different explanatory factors of
 variation behind the data. Although specific domain
 knowledge can be used to help design representations,
 learning with generic priors can also be used, and the
 quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful
 representation-learning algorithms implementing such
 priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of
 unsupervised feature learning and joint training of deep
 learning, covering advances in probabilistic models,
 auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep architectures.
 This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the
 appropriate objectives for learning good representations,
 for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the
 geometrical connections between representation learning,

  Abstract                 = {Background: Population movements following disasters can
 cause important increases in morbidity and mortality.
 Without knowledge of the locations of affected people,
 relief assistance is compromised. No rapid and accurate
 method exists to track population movements after
 disasters. We used position data of subscriber identity
 module (SIM) cards from the largest mobile phone company in
 Haiti (Digicel) to estimate the magnitude and trends of
 population movements following the Haiti 2010 earthquake
 and cholera outbreak. Methods and Findings: Geographic
 positions of SIM cards were determined by the location of
 the mobile phone tower through which each SIM card connects
 when calling. We followed daily positions of SIM cards 42
 days before the earthquake and 158 days after. To exclude
 inactivated SIM cards, we included only the 1.9 million SIM
 cards that made at least one call both pre-earthquake and
 during the last month of study. In Port-au-Prince there
 were 3.2 persons per included SIM card. We used this ratio
 to extrapolate from the number of moving SIM cards to the
 number of moving persons. Cholera outbreak analyses covered
 8 days and tracked 138,560 SIM cards. An estimated 630,000
 persons (197,484 Digicel SIM cards), present in
 Port-au-Prince on the day of the earthquake, had left 19
 days post-earthquake. Estimated net outflow of people
 (outflow minus inflow) corresponded to 20% of the
 Port-au-Prince pre-earthquake population. Geographic
 distribution of population movements from Port-au-Prince
 corresponded well with results from a large retrospective,
 population-based UN survey. To demonstrate feasibility of
 rapid estimates and to identify areas at potentially
 increased risk of outbreaks, we produced reports on SIM
 card movements from a cholera outbreak area at its
 immediate onset and within 12 hours of receiving data.
 Conclusions: Results suggest that estimates of population
 movements during disasters and outbreaks can be delivered
 rapidly and with potentially high validity in areas with
 high mobile phone use.},

  Abstract                 = {Coordination of distributed agents is required for problems arising in many areas, including multi-robot systems, networking and e-commerce. As a formal framework for such problems, we use the decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DECPOMDP). Though much work has been done on optimal dynamic programming algorithms for the single-agent version of the problem, optimal algorithms for the multiagent case have been elusive. The main contribution of this paper is an optimal policy iteration algorithm for solving DEC-POMDPs. The algorithm uses stochastic finite-state controllers to represent policies. The solution can include a correlation device, which allows agents to correlate their actions without communicating. This approach alternates between expanding the controller and performing value-preserving transformations, which modify the controller without sacrificing value. We present two efficient value-preserving transformations: one can reduce the size of the controller and the other can improve its value while keeping the size fixed. Empirical results demonstrate the usefulness of value-preserving transformations in increasing value while keeping controller size to a minimum. To broaden the applicability of the approach, we also present a heuristic version of the policy iteration algorithm, which sacrifices convergence to optimality. This algorithm further reduces the size of the controllers at each step by assuming that probability distributions over the other agents' actions are known. While this assumption may not hold in general, it helps produce higher quality solutions in our test problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Realtime crowdsourcing research has demonstrated that it
 is possible to recruit paid crowds within seconds by
 managing a small, fast-reacting worker pool. Realtime
 crowds enable crowd-powered systems that respond at
 interactive speeds: for example, cameras, robots and
 instant opinion polls. So far, these techniques have mainly
 been proof-of-concept prototypes: research has not yet
 attempted to understand how they might work at large scale
 or optimize their cost/performance trade-offs. In this
 paper, we use queueing theory to analyze the retainer model
 for realtime crowdsourcing, in particular its expected wait
 time and cost to requesters. We provide an algorithm that
 allows requesters to minimize their cost subject to
 performance requirements. We then propose and analyze three
 techniques to improve performance: push notifications,
 shared retainer pools, and precruitment, which involves
 recalling retainer workers before a task actually arrives.
 An experimental validation finds that precruited workers
 begin a task 500 milliseconds after it is posted,
 delivering results below the one-second cognitive threshold
 for an end-user to stay in flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Social networks often serve as a medium for the diffusion
 of ideas or innovations. An individual's decision whether
 to adopt a product or innovation will be highly dependent
 on the choices made by the individual's peers or neighbors
 in the social network. In this work, we study the game of
 innovation diffusion with multiple competing innovations
 such as when multiple companies market competing products
 using viral marketing. Our first contribution is a natural
 and mathematically tractable model for the diffusion of
 multiple innovations in a network.We give a (1-1/e)
 approximation algorithm for computing the best response to
 an opponent's strategy, and prove that the "price of
 competition" of this game is at most 2. We also discuss
 "first mover" strategies which try to maximize the expected
 diffusion against perfect competition. Finally, we give an
 FPTAS for the problem of maximizing the influence of a
 single player when the underlying graph is a tree.},

  Abstract                 = {{The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine
 learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by
 many important developments in the underlying algorithms
 and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown
 from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while
 graphical models have emerged as a general framework for
 describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The
 practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been
 greatly enhanced by the development of a range of
 approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes
 and expectation propagation, while new models based on
 kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms
 and applications. This completely new textbook reflects
 these recent developments while providing a comprehensive
 introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and
 machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or
 first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and
 practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition
 or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with
 multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required,
 and some experience in the use of probabilities would be
 helpful though not essential as the book includes a
 self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.
 The book is suitable for courses on machine learning,
 statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer
 vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support
 is provided for course instructors, including more than 400
 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example
 solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from
 the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be
 obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is
 supported by a great deal of additional material, and the
 reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the
 latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will
 deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and
 machine learning, and will include free software
 implementations of the key algorithms along with example
 data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is
 Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and
 also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of
 Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and
 was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of
 Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural
 Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely
 adopted.}},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key
 driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on
 geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of
 interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene
 pools. Human travel, for example, is responsible for the
 geographical spread of human infectious disease. In the
 light of increasing international trade, intensified human
 mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A
 epidemic, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical
 properties of human travel is of fundamental importance.
 Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of
 these properties on geographical scales remains elusive,
 and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still
 prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and
 quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by
 analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United
 States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million
 individual displacements, we find that dispersal is
 anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of
 travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that
 trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free
 random walks known as Levy flights. Second, the probability
 of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a
 time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that
 attenuate the superdiffusive spread.We show that human
 travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on
 many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter
 continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy,
 and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an
 ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Computational models play an increasingly
 important role in the assessment and control of public
 health crises, as demonstrated during the 2009 H1N1
 influenza pandemic. Much research has been done in recent
 years in the development of sophisticated data-driven
 models for realistic computer-based simulations of
 infectious disease spreading. However, only a few
 computational tools are presently available for assessing
 scenarios, predicting epidemic evolutions, and managing
 health emergencies that can benefit a broad audience of
 users including policy makers and health
 institutions.RESULTS:We present "GLEaMviz", a publicly
 available software system that simulates the spread of
 emerging human-to-human infectious diseases across the
 world. The GLEaMviz tool comprises three components: the
 client application, the proxy middleware, and the
 simulation engine. The latter two components constitute the
 GLEaMviz server. The simulation engine leverages on the
 Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework, a
 stochastic computational scheme that integrates worldwide
 high-resolution demographic and mobility data to simulate
 disease spread on the global scale. The GLEaMviz design
 aims at maximizing flexibility in defining the disease
 compartmental model and configuring the simulation
 scenario; it allows the user to set a variety of parameters
 including: compartment-specific features, transition
 values, and environmental effects. The output is a dynamic
 map and a corresponding set of charts that quantitatively
 describe the geo-temporal evolution of the disease. The
 software is designed as a client-server system. The
 multi-platform client, which can be installed on the user's
 local machine, is used to set up simulations that will be
 executed on the server, thus avoiding specific requirements
 for large computational capabilities on the user
 side.CONCLUSIONS:The user-friendly graphical interface of
 the GLEaMviz tool, along with its high level of detail and
 the realism of its embedded modeling approach, opens up the
 platform to simulate realistic epidemic scenarios. These
 features make the GLEaMviz computational tool a convenient
 teaching/training tool as well as a first step toward the
 development of a computational tool aimed at facilitating
 the use and exploitation of computational models for the
 policy making and scenario analysis of infectious disease
 outbreaks.},

  Abstract                 = {Evaluating the impact of different social networks on the
 spread of respiratory diseases has been limited by a lack
 of detailed data on transmission outside the household
 setting as well as appropriate statistical methods. Here,
 from data collected during a H1N1 pandemic (pdm) influenza
 outbreak that started in an elementary school and spread in
 a semirural community in Pennsylvania, we quantify how
 transmission of influenza is affected by social networks.
 We set up a transmission model for which parameters are
 estimated from the data via Markov chain Monte Carlo
 sampling. Sitting next to a case or being the playmate of a
 case did not significantly increase the risk of infection;
 but the structuring of the school into classes and grades
 strongly affected spread. There was evidence that boys were
 more likely to transmit influenza to other boys than to
 girls (and vice versa), which mimicked the observed
 assortative mixing among playmates. We also investigated
 the presence of abnormally high transmission occurring on
 specific days of the outbreak. Late closure of the school
 (i.e., when 27% of students already had symptoms) had no
 significant impact on spread. School-aged individuals
 (6–18 y) facilitated the introduction and spread of
 influenza in households, but only about one in five cases
 aged >18 y was infected by a school-aged household member.
 This analysis shows the extent to which clearly defined
 social networks affect influenza transmission, revealing
 strong between-place interactions with back-and-forth waves
 of transmission between the school, the community, and the
 household.},

  Abstract                 = {Making complex decisions in real world problems often
 involves assigning values to sets of interdependent
 variables where an expressive dependency structure among
 these can influence, or even dictate, what assignments are
 possible. Commonly used models typically ignore expressive
 dependencies since the traditional way of incorporating
 non-local dependencies is inefficient and hence leads to
 expensive training and inference.

 The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, this
 paper presents Constrained Conditional Models (CCMs), a
 framework that augments linear models with declarative
 constraints as a way to support decisions in an expressive
 output space while maintaining modularity and tractability
 of training. The paper develops, analyzes and compares
 novel algorithms for CCMs based on HiddenMarkovModels and
 Structured Perceptron. The proposed CCM framework is also
 compared to task-tailored models, such as semi-CRFs.

 Second, we propose CoDL, a constraint-driven learning
 algorithm, which makes use of constraints to guide
 semi-supervised learning.We provide theoretical
 justification for CoDL along with empirical results which
 show the advantage of using declarative constraints in the
 context of semi-supervised training of probabilistic
 models.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND

 The prevalence of smoking has decreased substantially in
 the United States over the past 30 years. We examined the
 extent of the person-to-person spread of smoking behavior
 and the extent to which groups of widely connected people
 quit together.

 METHODS

 We studied a densely interconnected social network of
 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part
 of the Framingham Heart Study. We used network analytic
 methods and longitudinal statistical models.

 RESULTS

 Discernible clusters of smokers and nonsmokers were present
 in the network, and the clusters extended to three degrees
 of separation. Despite the decrease in smoking in the
 overall population, the size of the clusters of smokers
 remained the same across time, suggesting that whole groups
 of people were quitting in concert. Smokers were also
 progressively found in the periphery of the social network.
 Smoking cessation by a spouse decreased a person?s chances
 of smoking by 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59 to 73).
 Smoking cessation by a sibling decreased the chances by 25%
 (95% CI, 14 to 35). Smoking cessation by a friend decreased
 the chances by 36% (95% CI, 12 to 55 ). Among persons
 working in small firms, smoking cessation by a coworker
 decreased the chances by 34% (95% CI, 5 to 56). Friends
 with more education influenced one another more than those
 with less education. These effects were not seen among
 neighbors in the immediate geographic area.

 CONCLUSIONS

 Network phenomena appear to be relevant to smoking
 cessation. Smoking behavior spreads through close and
 distant social ties, groups of interconnected people stop
 smoking in concert, and smokers are increasingly
 marginalized socially. These findings have implications for
 clinical and public health interventions to reduce and
 prevent smoking.},

  Abstract                 = {Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?
 The question invites two standard replies. Some accept the
 boundaries of skin and skull, and say that what is outside
 the body is outside the mind. Others are impressed by
 arguments suggesting that the meaning of our words `just
 ain't in the head', and hold that this externalism about
 meaning carries over into an externalism about mind. We
 propose to pursue a third position. We advocate a very
 different sort of externalism: an active externalism, based
 on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive
 processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The systematic study of large-scale networks has unveiled
 the ubiquitous presence of connectivity patterns
 characterized by large-scale heterogeneities and unbounded
 statistical fluctuations. These features affect
 dramatically the behavior of the diffusion processes
 occurring on networks, determining the ensuing statistical
 properties of their evolution pattern and dynamics. In this
 article, we present a stochastic computational framework
 for the forecast of global epidemics that considers the
 complete worldwide air travel infrastructure complemented
 with census population data. We address two basic issues in
 global epidemic modeling: (i) we study the role of the
 large scale properties of the airline transportation
 network in determining the global diffusion pattern of
 emerging diseases; and (ii) we evaluate the reliability of
 forecasts and outbreak scenarios with respect to the
 intrinsic stochasticity of disease transmission and traffic
 flows. To address these issues we define a set of
 quantitative measures able to characterize the level of
 heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern.
 These measures may be used for the analysis of containment
 policies and epidemic risk assessment.},

  Abstract                 = {We study fifteen months of human mobility data for one and
 a half million individuals and find that human mobility
 traces are highly unique. In fact, in a dataset where the
 location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a
 spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's
 antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to
 uniquely identify 95% of the individuals. We coarsen the
 data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the
 uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution
 and the available outside information. This formula shows
 that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately
 as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse
 datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent
 fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have
 important implications for the design of frameworks and
 institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of
 individuals.},

  Abstract                 = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated
 implementation for processing and generating large data
 sets. Users specify a \_map\_ function that processes a
 key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value
 pairs, and a \_reduce\_ function that merges all
 intermediate values associated with the same intermediate
 key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model,
 as shown in the paper. <P> Programs written in this
 functional style are automatically parallelized and
 executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The
 run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning
 the input data, scheduling the program's execution across a
 set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing
 the required inter- machine communication. This allows
 programmers without any experience with parallel and
 distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a
 large distributed system. <P> Our implementation of
 MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and
 is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation
 processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines.
 Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of
 MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one
 thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters
 every day. <P>},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet is a critically important research site for
 sociologists testing theories of technology diffusion and
 media effects, particularly because it is a medium uniquely
 capable of integrating modes of communication and forms of
 content. Current research tends to focus on the
 Internet’s implications in five domains: 1) inequality
 (the “digital divide”); 2) community and social
 capital; 3) political participation; 4) organizations and
 other economic institutions; and 5) cultural participation
 and cultural diversity. A recurrent theme across domains is
 that the Internet tends to complement rather than displace
 existing media and patterns of behavior. Thus in each
 domain, utopian claims and dystopic warnings based on
 extrapolations from technical possibilities have given way
 to more nuanced and circumscribed understandings of how
 Internet use adapts to existing patterns, permits certain
 innovations, and reinforces particular kinds of change.
 Moreover, in each domain the ultimate social implications
 of this new technology depend on economic, legal, and
 policy decisions that are shaping the Internet as it
 becomes institutionalized. Sociologists need to study the
 Internet more actively and, particularly, to synthesize
 research findings on individual user behavior with
 macroscopic analyses of institutional and
 political-economic factors that constrain that behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {This lecture treats some enduring misconceptions about
 modeling. One of these is that the goal is always
 prediction. The lecture distinguishes between explanation
 and prediction as modeling goals, and offers sixteen
 reasons other than prediction to build a model. It also
 challenges the common assumption that scientific theories
 arise from and 'summarize' data, when often, theories
 precede and guide data collection; without theory, in other
 words, it is not clear what data to collect. Among other
 things, it also argues that the modeling enterprise
 enforces habits of mind essential to freedom. It is based
 on the author's 2008 Bastille Day keynote address to the
 Second World Congress on Social Simulation, George Mason
 University, and earlier addresses at the Institute of
 Medicine, the University of Michigan, and the Santa Fe
 Institute.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we discover the daily location-driven
 routines that are contained in a massive real-life human
 dataset collected by mobile phones. Our goal is the
 discovery and analysis of human routines that characterize
 both individual and group behaviors in terms of location
 patterns. We develop an unsupervised methodology based on
 two differing probabilistic topic models and apply them to
 the daily life of 97 mobile phone users over a 16-month
 period to achieve these goals. Topic models are
 probabilistic generative models for documents that identify
 the latent structure that underlies a set of words.
 Routines dominating the entire group's activities,
 identified with a methodology based on the Latent Dirichlet
 Allocation topic model, include "going to work late",
 "going home early", "working nonstop" and "having no
 reception (phone off)" at different times over varying
 time-intervals. We also detect routines which are
 characteristic of users, with a methodology based on the
 Author-Topic model. With the routines discovered, and the
 two methods of characterizing days and users, we can then
 perform various tasks. We use the routines discovered to
 determine behavioral patterns of users and groups of users.
 For example, we can find individuals that display specific
 daily routines, such as "going to work early" or "turning
 off the mobile (or having no reception) in the evenings".
 We are also able to characterize daily patterns by
 determining the topic structure of days in addition to
 determining whether certain routines occur dominantly on
 weekends or weekdays. Furthermore, the routines discovered
 can be used to rank users or find subgroups of users who
 display certain routines. We can also characterize users
 based on their entropy. We compare our method to one based
 on clustering using K-means. Finally, we analyze an
 individual's routines over time to determine regions with
 high variations, which may correspond to specific events.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread rapidly across
 the globe. Judging its pandemic potential is difficult with
 limited data, but nevertheless essential to inform
 appropriate health responses. By analyzing the outbreak in
 Mexico, early data on international spread, and viral
 genetic diversity, we make an early assessment of
 transmissibility and severity. Our estimates suggest that
 23,000 (range 6000 to 32,000) individuals had been infected
 in Mexico by late April, giving an estimated case fatality
 ratio (CFR) of 0.4% (range: 0.3 to 1.8%) based on confirmed
 and suspected deaths reported to that time. In a community
 outbreak in the small community of La Gloria, Veracruz, no
 deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95%
 bound on CFR of 0.6%. Thus, although substantial
 uncertainty remains, clinical severity appears less than
 that seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic but comparable
 with that seen in the 1957 pandemic. Clinical attack rates
 in children in La Gloria were twice that in adults (<15
 years of age: 61%; >=15 years: 29%). Three different
 epidemiological analyses gave basic reproduction number
 (R0) estimates in the range of 1.4 to 1.6, whereas a
 genetic analysis gave a central estimate of 1.2. This range
 of values is consistent with 14 to 73 generations of
 human-to-human transmission having occurred in Mexico to
 late April. Transmissibility is therefore substantially
 higher than that of seasonal flu, and comparable with lower
 estimates of R0 obtained from previous influenza
 pandemics.},

  Abstract                 = {Human behaviour plays an important role in the spread of
 infectious diseases, and understanding the influence of
 behaviour on the spread of diseases can be key to improving
 control efforts. While behavioural responses to the spread
 of a disease have often been reported anecdotally, there
 has been relatively little systematic investigation into
 how behavioural changes can affect disease dynamics.
 Mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases
 are an important tool for investigating and quantifying
 such effects, not least because the spread of a disease
 among humans is not amenable to direct experimental study.
 Here, we review recent efforts to incorporate human
 behaviour into disease models, and propose that such models
 can be broadly classified according to the type and source
 of information which individuals are assumed to base their
 behaviour on, and according to the assumed effects of such
 behaviour. We highlight recent advances as well as gaps in
 our understanding of the interplay between infectious
 disease dynamics and human behaviour, and suggest what kind
 of data taking efforts would be helpful in filling these
 gaps.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we argue that it is necessary to study the
 communicative and coordinative practices in order to
 understand how the successful team operation of dynamic
 systems is constituted. We present a fourfold criticism of
 the view where communication is treated as the transmission
 of information and where coordination is regarded as the
 transfer of commands between individuals. Instead we adopt
 the distributed cognition framework and thereby shift our
 unit of analysis from the individual to the whole cognitive
 system comprising a team of people as well as the artefacts
 which they use. Through two field studies we try to
 demonstrate how communication and coordination are actively
 constructed in teams operating a dynamic systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract When a computer network connects people or
 organizations, it is a social network. Yet the study of
 such computer-supported social networks has not received as
 much attention as studies of human-computer interaction,
 online person-to-person interaction, and computer-supported
 communication within small groups. We argue the usefulness
 of a social network approach for the study of
 computer-mediated communication. We review some basic
 concepts of social network analysis, describe how to
 collect and analyze social network data, and demonstrate
 where social network data can be, and have been, used to
 study computer-mediated communication. Throughout, we show
 the utility of the social network approach for studying
 computer-mediated communication, be it in
 computer-supported cooperative work, in virtual community,
 or in more diffuse interactions over less bounded systems
 such as the Internet.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Influenza is a viral infection that primarily
 spreads via fluid droplets from an infected person's coughs
 and sneezes to others nearby. Social contact networks and
 the way people interact within them are thus important to
 its spread. We developed a method to characterize the
 social contact network for the potential transmission of
 influenza and then applied the method to school aged
 children and teenagers.METHODS:Surveys were administered to
 students in an elementary, middle and high-school in the
 United States. The social contact network of a person was
 conceptualized as a set of groups to which they belong
 (e.g., households, classes, clubs) each composed of a
 sub-network of primary links representing the individuals
 within each group that they contact. The size of the group,
 number of primary links, time spent in the group, and level
 of contact along each primary link (near, talking,
 touching, or kissing) were characterized. Public activities
 done by groups venturing into the community where random
 contacts occur (e.g., friends viewing a movie) also were
 characterized.RESULTS:Students, groups and public
 activities were highly heterogeneous. Groups with high
 potential for the transmission of influenza were
 households, school classes, friends, and sports; households
 decreased and friends and sports increased in importance
 with grade level. Individual public activity events (such
 as dances) were also important but lost their importance
 when averaged over time. Random contacts, primarily in
 school passing periods, were numerous but had much lower
 transmission potential compared to those with primary links
 within groups. Students are highly assortative, interacting
 mainly within age class. A small number of individual
 students are identified as likely
 "super-spreaders".CONCLUSION:High-school students may form
 the local transmission backbone of the next pandemic.
 Closing schools and keeping students at home during a
 pandemic would remove the transmission potential within
 these ages and could be effective at thwarting its spread
 within a community. Social contact networks characterized
 as groups and public activities with the time, level of
 contact and primary links within each, yields a
 comprehensive view, which if extended to all ages, would
 allow design of effective community containment for
 pandemic influenza.},

  Abstract                 = {Decentralized control of cooperative systems captures the operation of a group of decision-makers that share a single global objective. The difficulty in solving optimally such problems arises when the agents lack full observability of the global state of the system when they operate. The general problem has been shown to be NEXP-complete. In this paper, we identify classes of decentralized control problems whose complexity ranges between NEXP and P. In particular, we study problems characterized by independent transitions, independent observations, and goal-oriented objective functions. Two algorithms are shown to solve optimally useful classes of goal-oriented decentralized processes in polynomial time. This paper also studies information sharing among the decision-makers, which can improve their performance. We distinguish between three ways in which agents can exchange information: indirect communication, direct communication and sharing state features that are not controlled by the agents. Our analysis shows that for every class of problems we consider, introducing direct or indirect communication does not change the worst-case complexity. The results provide a better understanding of the complexity of decentralized control problems that arise in practice and facilitate the development of planning algorithms for these problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic
 forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile
 viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing
 human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to
 monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we
 study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone
 users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We
 find that, in contrast with the random trajectories
 predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk
 models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal
 and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized
 by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a
 significant probability to return to a few highly
 frequented locations. After correcting for differences in
 travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each
 trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a
 single spatial probability distribution, indicating that,
 despite the diversity of their travel history, humans
 follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent
 similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena
 driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to
 emergency response, urban planning and agent-based
 modelling.},

  Abstract                 = {The emulation theory of representation is developed and
 explored as a framework that can revealingly synthesize a
 wide variety of representational functions of the brain.
 The framework is based on constructs from control theory
 (forward models) and signal processing (Kalman filters).
 The idea is that in addition to simply engaging with the
 body and environment, the brain constructs neural circuits
 that act as models of the body and environment. During
 overt sensorimotor engagement, these models are driven by
 efference copies in parallel with the body and environment,
 in order to provide expectations of the sensory feedback,
 and to enhance and process sensory information. These
 models can also be run off-line in order to produce
 imagery, estimate outcomes of different actions, and
 evaluate and develop motor plans. The framework is
 initially developed within the context of motor control,
 where it has been shown that inner models running in
 parallel with the body can reduce the effects of feedback
 delay problems. The same mechanisms can account for motor
 imagery as the off-line driving of the emulator via
 efference copies. The framework is extended to account for
 visual imagery as the off-line driving of an emulator of
 the motor-visual loop. I also show how such systems can
 provide for amodal spatial imagery. Perception, including
 visual perception, results from such models being used to
 form expectations of, and to interpret, sensory input. I
 close by briefly outlining other cognitive functions that
 might also be synthesized within this framework, including
 reasoning, theory of mind phenomena, and language.},

  Abstract                 = {Network analysis is currently used in a myriad of
 contexts, from identifying potential drug targets to
 predicting the spread of epidemics and designing
 vaccination strategies and from finding friends to
 uncovering criminal activity. Despite the promise of the
 network approach, the reliability of network data is a
 source of great concern in all fields where complex
 networks are studied. Here, we present a general
 mathematical and computational framework to deal with the
 problem of data reliability in complex networks. In
 particular, we are able to reliably identify both missing
 and spurious interactions in noisy network observations.
 Remarkably, our approach also enables us to obtain, from
 those noisy observations, network reconstructions that
 yield estimates of the true network properties that are
 more accurate than those provided by the observations
 themselves. Our approach has the potential to guide
 experiments, to better characterize network data sets, and
 to drive new discoveries.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews studies explicitly applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to behaviour change interventions. A systematic and multiple search strategy identified 30 papers, describing 24 distinct interventions. Studies were rarely explicit about use of the TPB. The TPB was mainly used to measure process and outcome variables and to predict intention and behaviour, and less commonly to develop the intervention. Behaviour change methods were mostly persuasion and information, with increasing skills, goal setting, and rehearsal of skills used less often. When reported, half of the interventions were effective in changing intention, and two-thirds in changing behaviour, with generally small effect sizes, where calculable. Effectiveness was unrelated to use of the theory to develop interventions. Evidence about mediation of effects by TPB components was sparse. The TPB may have potential for developing behaviour change interventions, but more comprehensive studies are needed that compare the utility of the TPB with other social cognition models and behavioural techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Medical informatics has been guided by an
 individual-centered model of human cognition, inherited
 from classical theory of mind, in which knowledge,
 problem-solving, and information-processing responsible for
 intelligent behavior all derive from the inner workings of
 an individual agent.

 Objectives and results: In this paper we argue that medical
 informatics commitment to the classical model of cognition
 conflates the processing performed by the minds of
 individual agents with the processing performed by the
 larger distributed activity systems within which
 individuals operate. We review trends in cognitive science
 that seek to close the gap between general-purpose models
 of cognition and applied considerations of real-world human
 performance. One outcome is the theory of distributed
 cognition, in which the unit of analysis for understanding
 performance is the activity system which comprises a group
 of human actors, their tools and environment, and is
 organized by a particular history of goal-directed action
 and interaction.

 Conclusion: We describe and argue for the relevance of
 distributed cognition to medical informatics, both for the
 study of human performance in healthcare and for the design
 of technologies meant to enhance this performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive science normally takes the individual agent as
 its unit of analysis. In many human endeavors, however, the
 outcomes of interest are not determined entirely by the
 information processing properties of individuals. Nor can
 they be inferred from the properties of the individual
 agents, alone, no matter how detailed the knowledge of the
 properties of those individuals may be. In commercial
 aviation, for example, the successful completion of a
 flight is produced by a system that typically includes two
 or more pilots interacting with each other and with a suite
 of technological devices. This article presents a
 theoretical framework that takes a distributed,
 socio-technical system rather than an individual mind as
 its primary unit of analysis. This framework is explicitly
 cognitive in that it is concerned with how information is
 represented and how representations are transformed and
 propagated in the performance of tasks. An analysis of a
 memory task in the cockpit of a commercial airliner shows
 how the cognitive properties of such distributed systems
 can differ radically from the cognitive properties of the
 individuals who inhabit them.},

  Abstract                 = { <p>Maximum parsimony (MP) methods aim to reconstruct the
 phylogeny of extant species by finding the most
 parsimonious evolutionary scenario using the species'
 genome data. MP methods are considered to be accurate, but
 they are also computationally expensive especially for a
 large number of species. Several disk-covering methods
 (DCMs), which decompose the input species to multiple
 overlapping subgroups (or disks), have been proposed to
 solve the problem in a divide-and-conquer way.</p> <p>We
 design a new DCM based on the spectral method and also
 develop the <italic>COGNAC</italic> (Comparing Orders of
 Genes using Novel Algorithms and high-performance
 Computers) software package. <italic>COGNAC</italic> uses
 the new DCM to reduce the phylogenetic tree search space
 and selects an output tree from the reduced search space
 based on the MP principle. We test the new DCM using gene
 order data and inversion distance. The new DCM not only
 reduces the number of candidate tree topologies but also
 excludes erroneous tree topologies which can be selected by
 original MP methods. Initial labeling of internal genomes
 affects the accuracy of MP methods using gene order data,
 and the new DCM enables more accurate initial labeling as
 well. <italic>COGNAC</italic> demonstrates superior
 accuracy as a consequence. We compare
 <italic>COGNAC</italic> with FastME and the combination of
 the state of the art DCM (Rec-I-DCM3) and GRAPPA .
 <italic>COGNAC</italic> clearly outperforms FastME in
 accuracy. <italic>COGNAC</italic> –using the new
 DCM–also reconstructs a much more accurate tree in
 significantly shorter time than GRAPPA with Rec-I-DCM3.</p>

  Abstract                 = {In this study we analyze the travel patterns of 500,000
 individuals in Cote d'Ivoire using mobile phone call data
 records. By measuring the uncertainties of movements using
 entropy, considering both the frequencies and temporal
 correlations of individual trajectories, we find that the
 theoretical maximum predictability is as high as 88%. To
 verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached,
 we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to
 predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results
 show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of
 87% for stationary trajectories and 95% for non-stationary
 trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is
 highly dependent on historical behaviors, and that the
 maximum predictability is not only a fundamental
 theoretical limit for potential predictive power, but also
 an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Amazon's Mechanical Turk is an online labor market where
 requesters post jobs and workers choose which jobs to do
 for pay. The central purpose of this article is to
 demonstrate how to use this Web site for conducting
 behavioral research and to lower the barrier to entry for
 researchers who could benefit from this platform. We
 describe general techniques that apply to a variety of
 types of research and experiments across disciplines. We
 begin by discussing some of the advantages of doing
 experiments on Mechanical Turk, such as easy access to a
 large, stable, and diverse subject pool, the low cost of
 doing experiments, and faster iteration between developing
 theory and executing experiments. While other methods of
 conducting behavioral research may be comparable to or even
 better than Mechanical Turk on one or more of the axes
 outlined above, we will show that when taken as a whole
 Mechanical Turk can be a useful tool for many researchers.
 We will discuss how the behavior of workers compares with
 that of experts and laboratory subjects. Then we will
 illustrate the mechanics of putting a task on Mechanical
 Turk, including recruiting subjects, executing the task,
 and reviewing the work that was submitted. We also provide
 solutions to common problems that a researcher might face
 when executing their research on this platform, including
 techniques for conducting synchronous experiments, methods
 for ensuring high-quality work, how to keep data private,
 and how to maintain code security.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a new method for segmentation of molecular
 surfaces. Topological analysis of a scalar function defined
 on the surface and its associated gradient field reveals
 the relationship between the features of interest and
 critical points of the scalar function. The segmentation is
 obtained by associating segments with local minima/maxima.
 Controlled simplification of the function merges segments
 resulting in a hierarchical segmentation of the molecular
 surface. This segmentation is used to identify rigid
 components of proteins molecules and to study the role of
 cavities and protrusions in protein-protein interactions.},

  Abstract                 = { <sec> <title>Background</title> <p>Seroepidemiological
 studies before and after the epidemic wave of H1N1-2009 are
 useful for estimating population attack rates with a
 potential to validate early estimates of the reproduction
 number, <italic>R</italic>, in modeling studies.</p> </sec>
 <sec> <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
 <p>Since the final epidemic size, the proportion of
 individuals in a population who become infected during an
 epidemic, is not the result of a binomial sampling process
 because infection events are not independent of each other,
 we propose the use of an asymptotic distribution of the
 final size to compute approximate 95\% confidence intervals
 of the observed final size. This allows the comparison of
 the observed final sizes against predictions based on the
 modeling study (<italic>R</italic> = 1.15, 1.40 and
 1.90), which also yields simple formulae for determining
 sample sizes for future seroepidemiological studies. We
 examine a total of eleven published seroepidemiological
 studies of H1N1-2009 that took place after observing the
 peak incidence in a number of countries. Observed
 seropositive proportions in six studies appear to be
 smaller than that predicted from
 <italic>R</italic> = 1.40; four of the six studies
 sampled serum less than one month after the reported peak
 incidence. The comparison of the observed final sizes
 against <italic>R</italic> = 1.15 and 1.90 reveals that
 all eleven studies appear not to be significantly deviating
 from the prediction with <italic>R</italic> = 1.15, but
 final sizes in nine studies indicate overestimation if the
 value <italic>R</italic> = 1.90 is used.</p> </sec>
 <sec> <title>Conclusions</title> <p>Sample sizes of
 published seroepidemiological studies were too small to
 assess the validity of model predictions except when
 <italic>R</italic> = 1.90 was used. We recommend the
 use of the proposed approach in determining the sample size
 of post-epidemic seroepidemiological studies, calculating
 the 95\% confidence interval of observed final size, and
 conducting relevant hypothesis testing instead of the use
 of methods that rely on a binomial proportion.</p> </sec> },

  Abstract                 = {<p>Individual-based epidemiology models are increasingly
 used in the study of influenza epidemics. Several studies
 on influenza dynamics and evaluation of intervention
 measures have used the same incubation and infectious
 period distribution parameters based on the natural history
 of influenza. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the
 influence of slight changes to these parameters (in
 addition to the transmissibility) would be useful for
 future studies and real-time modeling during an influenza
 pandemic.</p><p>In this study, we examined individual and
 joint effects of parameters and ranked parameters based on
 their influence on the dynamics of simulated epidemics. We
 also compared the sensitivity of the model across synthetic
 social networks for Montgomery County in Virginia and New
 York City (and surrounding metropolitan regions) with
 demographic and rural-urban differences. In addition, we
 studied the effects of changing the mean infectious period
 on age-specific epidemics. The research was performed from
 a public health standpoint using three relevant measures:
 time to peak, peak infected proportion and total attack
 rate. We also used statistical methods in the design and
 analysis of the experiments.</p><p>The results showed that:
 (i) minute changes in the transmissibility and mean
 infectious period significantly influenced the attack rate;
 (ii) the mean of the incubation period distribution
 appeared to be sufficient for determining its effects on
 the dynamics of epidemics; (iii) the infectious period
 distribution had the strongest influence on the structure
 of the epidemic curves; (iv) the sensitivity of the
 individual-based model was consistent across social
 networks investigated in this study and (v) age-specific
 epidemics were sensitive to changes in the mean infectious
 period irrespective of the susceptibility of the other age
 groups. These findings suggest that small changes in some
 of the disease model parameters can significantly influence
 the uncertainty observed in real-time forecasting and
 predicting of the characteristics of an epidemic.</p>}

  Abstract                 = {Accurate disease forecasts are imperative when preparing
 for influenza epidemic outbreaks; nevertheless, these
 forecasts are often limited by the time required to collect
 new, accurate data. In this paper, we show that data from
 the microblogging community Twitter significantly improves
 influenza forecasting. Most prior influenza forecast models
 are tested against historical influenza-like illness (ILI)
 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
 Prevention (CDC). These data are released with a one-week
 lag and are often initially inaccurate until the CDC
 revises them weeks later. Since previous studies utilize
 the final, revised data in evaluation, their evaluations do
 not properly determine the effectiveness of forecasting.
 Our experiments using ILI data available at the time of the
 forecast show that models incorporating data derived from
 Twitter can reduce forecasting error by 17-30\% over a
 baseline that only uses historical data. For a given level
 of accuracy, using Twitter data produces forecasts that are
 two to four weeks ahead of baseline models. Additionally,
 we find that models using Twitter data are, on average,
 better predictors of influenza prevalence than are models
 using data from Google Flu Trends, the leading web data
 source.},

 essential for urban planning and transportation management.
 Besides geographic space, in this paper, we characterize
 mobility in a profile-based space (activity-aware map) that
 describes most probable activity associated with a specific
 area of space. This, in turn, allows us to capture the
 individual daily activity pattern and analyze the
 correlations among different people's work area's profile.
 Based on a large mobile phone data of nearly one million
 records of the users in the central Metro-Boston area, we
 find a strong correlation in daily activity patterns within
 the group of people who share a common work area's profile.
 In addition, within the group itself, the similarity in
 activity patterns decreases as their work places become
 apart.},

 experience involves a modelling process. The human brain
 generates an internal model to fit incoming information
 about the external world, and experiences the model rather
 than the information. The modelling occurs at the level of
 the neocortex and may be associated with specific
 oscillatory field potentials. Imagining exercises the
 modelling system independently of sensory information.
 General disorders of consciousness are caused by damage to
 those areas of the brain that energize and direct the
 modelling process. Specific deficits of consciousness are
 caused by focal lesions to sensory or motor cortex that
 prevent the modelling of particular input and output
 patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Intentions, an integral part of the mental state of an
 agent, play an important role in determining the behavior
 of rational agents as they seek to attain their goals. In
 this paper, a formalization of intentions based on a
 branching-time possible-worlds model is presented. It is
 shown how the formalism realizes many of the important
 elements of Bratman's theory of intention. In particular,
 the notion of intention developed here has equal status
 with the notions of belief and desire.},

  Abstract                 = {How does the visual system learn an internal model of the
 external environment? How is this internal model used
 during visual perception? How are occlusions and background
 clutter so effortlessly discounted for when recognizing a
 familiar object? How is a particular object of interest
 attended to and recognized in the presence of other objects
 in the field of view? In this paper, we attempt to address
 these questions from the perspective of Bayesian optimal
 estimation theory. Using the concept of generative models
 and the statistical theory of Kalman filtering, we show how
 static and dynamic events occurring in the visual
 environment may be learned and recognized given only the
 input images. We also describe an extension of the Kalman
 filter model that can handle multiple objects in the field
 of view. The resulting robust Kalman filter model
 demonstrates how certain forms of attention can be viewed
 as an emergent property of the interaction between top-down
 expectations and bottom-up signals. Experimental results
 are provided to help demonstrate the ability of such a
 model to perform robust segmentation and recognition of
 objects and image sequences in the presence of occlusions
 and clutter.},

 word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents.
 The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are
 easy to infer and give a much better representation of each
 document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest
 layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables
 (e.g. 32), the graphical model performs "semantic hashing":
 Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that
 semantically similar documents are located at nearby
 addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then
 be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ
 by only a few bits from the address of the query document.
 This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to
 approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive
 hashing, which is the fastest current method. By using
 semantic hashing to filter the documents given to TF-IDF,
 we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the
 entire document set.},

 those with the highest potential for rapid pandemic
 spread—are usually transmitted via droplets during close
 proximity interactions (CPIs). Despite the importance of
 this transmission route, very little is known about the
 dynamic patterns of CPIs. Using wireless sensor network
 technology, we obtained high-resolution data of CPIs during
 a typical day at an American high school, permitting the
 reconstruction of the social network relevant for
 infectious disease transmission. At 94\% coverage, we
 collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal distance of 3 m among
 788 individuals. The data revealed a high-density network
 with typical small-world properties and a relatively
 homogeneous distribution of both interaction time and
 interaction partners among subjects. Computer simulations
 of the spread of an influenza-like disease on the weighted
 contact graph are in good agreement with absentee data
 during the most recent influenza season. Analysis of
 targeted immunization strategies suggested that contact
 network data are required to design strategies that are
 significantly more effective than random immunization.
 Immunization strategies based on contact network data were
 most effective at high vaccination coverage.}},

 temporal sequence processing: Generalized Hidden
 Semi-Markov Models (GHSMMs). GHSMMs are an extension of
 hidden Markov models to continuous time that builds on
 turning the stochastic process of hidden state traversals
 into a semi-Markov process. A large variety of probability
 distributions can be used to specify transition durations.

 It is shown how GHSMMs can be used to address the principle
 problems of temporal sequence processing: sequence
 generation, sequence recognition and sequence prediction.
 Additionally, an algorithm is described how the parameters
 of GHSMMs can be determined from a set of training data:
 The Baum-Welch algorithm is extended by an embedded
 expectation-maximization algorithm. Under some conditions
 the procedure can be simplified to the estimation of
 distribution moments. A proof of convergence and a
 complexity assessment are provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Influenza recurs seasonally in temperate regions of the
 world; however, our ability to predict the timing,
 duration, and magnitude of local seasonal outbreaks of
 influenza remains limited. Here we develop a framework for
 initializing real-time forecasts of seasonal influenza
 outbreaks, using a data assimilation technique commonly
 applied in numerical weather prediction. The availability
 of real-time, web-based estimates of local influenza
 infection rates makes this type of quantitative forecasting
 possible. Retrospective ensemble forecasts are generated on
 a weekly basis following assimilation of these web-based
 estimates for the 2003–2008 influenza seasons in New York
 City. The findings indicate that real-time skillful
 predictions of peak timing can be made more than 7 wk in
 advance of the actual peak. In addition, confidence in
 those predictions can be inferred from the spread of the
 forecast ensemble. This work represents an initial step in
 the development of a statistically rigorous system for
 real-time forecast of seasonal influenza.},

This system was used to generate and evaluate retrospective forecasts of influenza peak timing in New York City. Here we present weekly forecasts of seasonal influenza developed and run in real time for 108 cities in the USA during the recent 2012--2013 season. Reliable ensemble forecasts of influenza outbreak peak timing with leads of up to 9 weeks were produced. Forecast accuracy increased as the season progressed, and the forecasts significantly outperformed alternate, analogue prediction methods. By week 52, prior to peak for the majority of cities, 63{\%} of all ensemble forecasts were accurate. To our knowledge, this is the first time predictions of seasonal influenza have been made in real time and with demonstrated accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduced in its contemporary form in 1946 (ref. 1), but
 with roots that go back to the eighteenth century, the
 gravity law is the prevailing framework with which to
 predict population movement cargo shipping volume and
 inter-city phone calls as well as bilateral trade flows
 between nations. Despite its widespread use, it relies on
 adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and
 suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we
 introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility
 decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and
 mobility fluxes that require as input only information on
 the population distribution. The resulting radiation model
 predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility
 and transport patterns observed in a wide range of
 phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to
 communication volume between different regions. Given its
 parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas
 where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly
 improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena
 affected by mobility and transport processes},

  Abstract                 = {A range of applications, from predicting the spread of
 human and electronic viruses to city planning and resource
 management in mobile communications, depend on our ability
 to foresee the whereabouts and mobility of individuals,
 raising a fundamental question: To what degree is human
 behavior predictable? Here we explore the limits of
 predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility
 patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the
 entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93%
 potential predictability in user mobility across the whole
 user base. Despite the significant differences in the
 travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability
 in predictability, which is largely independent of the
 distance users cover on a regular basis.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new notion of graph sparsification based on
 spectral similarity of graph Laplacians: spectral
 sparsification requires that the Laplacian quadratic form
 of the sparsifier approximate that of the original. This is
 equivalent to saying that the Laplacian of the sparsifier
 is a good preconditioner for the Laplacian of the original.
 We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier of
 nearly linear size. Moreover, we present an algorithm that
 produces spectral sparsifiers in time $O(m\log^{c}m)$,
 where m is the number of edges in the original graph and c
 is some absolute constant. This construction is a key
 component of a nearly linear time algorithm for solving
 linear equations in diagonally dominant matrices. Our
 sparsification algorithm makes use of a nearly linear time
 algorithm for graph partitioning that satisfies a strong
 guarantee: if the partition it outputs is very unbalanced,
 then the larger part is contained in a subgraph of high
 conductance.},

  Abstract                 = {Policies to promote public health and welfare often fail
 or worsen the problems they are intended to solve.
 Evidence-based learning should prevent such policy
 resistance, but learning in complex systems is often weak
 and slow. Complexity hinders our ability to discover the
 delayed and distal impacts of interventions, generating
 unintended "side effects." Yet learning often fails even
 when strong evidence is available: common mental models
 lead to erroneous but self-confirming inferences, allowing
 harmful beliefs and behaviors to persist and undermining
 implementation of beneficial policies.

 Here I show how systems thinking and simulation modeling
 can help expand the boundaries of our mental models,
 enhance our ability to generate and learn from evidence,
 and catalyze effective change in public health and
 beyond.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies in the psychology of individual choice have
 identified numerous cognitive and other bounds on human
 rationality, often producing systematic errors and biases.
 Yet for the most part models of aggregate phenomena in
 management science and economics are not consistent with
 such micro-empirical knowledge of individual
 decision-making. One explanation has been the difficulty of
 extending the experimental methods used to study individual
 decisions to aggregate, dynamic settings. This paper
 reports an experiment on the generation of macrodynamics
 from microstructure in a common managerial context.
 Subjects manage a simulated inventory distribution system
 which contains multiple actors, feedbacks, nonlinearities,
 and time delays. The interaction of individual decisions
 with the structure of the simulated firm produces aggregate
 dynamics which systematically diverge from optimal
 behavior. An anchoring and adjustment heuristic for stock
 management is proposed as a model of the subjects' decision
 processes. Econometric tests show the rule explains the
 subjects' behavior well. The estimation results identify
 several `misperceptions of feedback' which account for the
 poor performance of the subjects. In particular, subjects
 are shown to be insensitive to the feedbacks from their
 decisions to the environment. Finally, the generality of
 the results is considered and implications for behavioral
 theories of aggregate social and economic dynamics are
 explored.},

  Abstract                 = {When the conditions are right, epidemics can potentially
 create a medical version of the Hobbesian nightmare - the
 war of all against all. A major outbreak of novel, fatal
 epidemic disease can quickly be followed both by plagues of
 fear, panic, suspicion and stigma; and by mass outbreaks of
 moral controversy, of potential solutions and of personal
 conversion to the many different causes which spring up.
 This distinctive collective social psychology has its own
 epidemic form, can be activated by other crises besides
 those of disease and is rooted in the fundamental
 properties of language and human interaction. It is thus a
 permanent part of the human condition - and widely known to
 be such.},

 his attention to the way young people--surrounded by
 high-tech toys and tools from birth--will likely affect the

 predictions on how today's 2- to 22-year-olds might reshape
 society. His observations about this enormously influential
 population, which will total 88 million in North America
 alone by the year 2000, range from the kind of employees
 they may eventually be to how they could be reached by
 marketers.}},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Mathematical and computational models for
 infectious diseases are increasingly used to support
 public-health decisions; however, their reliability is
 currently under debate. Real-time forecasts of epidemic
 spread using data-driven models have been hindered by the
 technical challenges posed by parameter estimation and
 validation. Data gathered for the 2009 H1N1 influenza
 crisis represent an unprecedented opportunity to validate
 real-time model predictions and define the main success
 criteria for different approaches.METHODS:We used the
 Global Epidemic and Mobility Model to generate stochastic
 simulations of epidemic spread worldwide, yielding (among
 other measures) the incidence and seeding events at a daily
 resolution for 3,362 subpopulations in 220 countries. Using
 a Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood analysis, the model
 provided an estimate of the seasonal transmission potential
 during the early phase of the H1N1 pandemic and generated
 ensemble forecasts for the activity peaks in the northern
 hemisphere in the fall/winter wave. These results were
 validated against the real-life surveillance data collected
 in 48 countries, and their robustness assessed by focusing
 on 1) the peak timing of the pandemic; 2) the level of
 spatial resolution allowed by the model; and 3) the
 clinical attack rate and the effectiveness of the vaccine.
 In addition, we studied the effect of data incompleteness
 on the prediction reliability.RESULTS:Real-time predictions
 of the peak timing are found to be in good agreement with
 the empirical data, showing strong robustness to data that
 may not be accessible in real time (such as pre-exposure
 immunity and adherence to vaccination campaigns), but that
 affect the predictions for the attack rates. The timing and
 spatial unfolding of the pandemic are critically sensitive
 to the level of mobility data integrated into the
 model.CONCLUSIONS:Our results show that large-scale models
 can be used to provide valuable real-time forecasts of
 influenza spreading, but they require high-performance
 computing. The quality of the forecast depends on the level
 of data integration, thus stressing the need for
 high-quality data in population-based models, and of
 progressive updates of validated available empirical
 knowledge to inform these models.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the results of an experiment which
 investigated elementary school children's conceptual
 knowledge about the earth. First-, 3rd-, and 5th grade
 children were asked a series of questions about the shape
 of the earth. Children's responses to these questions
 revealed considerable apparent inconsistency. For example,
 many children said that the earth is round but also stated
 that it has an end or edge from which people could fall. A
 great deal of this apparent inconsistency could be
 explained by assuming that the children used, in a
 consistent fashion, a mental model of the earth other than
 the spherical earth model. Five alternative mental models
 of the earth were identified: the rectangular earth, the
 disc earth, the dual earth, the hollow sphere, and the
 flattened sphere. It is argued that these models are
 constrained by certain presuppositions which children form
 based on interpretations of their everyday experience. Some
 of these models (the rectangular earth and the disc earth)
 seem to be initial models children construct before they
 are exposed to the culturally accepted information that the
 earth is a sphere. In the process of knowledge acquisition,
 children appear to modify their initial models to make them
 more consistent with the culturally accepted model by
 gradually reinterpreting their presuppositions. Synthetic
 models (such as the hollow sphere and the flattened sphere)
 are generated by children as a solution to the problems
 arising from the inconsistency between their initial model
 of a flat earth and the culturally accepted, scientific
 model of a spherical earth. Children come to understand
 that the earth is a sphere only when the presuppositions
 that gave rise to their initial models have been
 reinterpreted.},

  Abstract                 = {{Many of the major human infectious diseases, including
 some now confined to humans and absent from animals, are
 'new' ones that arose only after the origins of
 agriculture. Where did they come from? Why are they
 overwhelmingly of Old World origins? Here we show that
 answers to these questions are different for tropical and
 temperate diseases; for instance, in the relative
 importance of domestic animals and wild primates as
 sources. We identify five intermediate stages through which
 a pathogen exclusively infecting animals may become
 transformed into a pathogen exclusively infecting humans.
 We propose an initiative to resolve disputed origins of
 major diseases, and a global early warning system to
 monitor pathogens infecting individuals exposed to wild
 animals.}},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:The Ebola outbreak that is sweeping across West Africa is the largest, most volatile, and deadliest Ebola epidemic ever recorded. Liberia is the most profoundly affected country, with more than 3500 infections and 2000 deaths recorded in the past 3 months.

OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the contribution of disease progression and case fatality on transmission and to examine the potential for targeted interventions to eliminate the disease.

DESIGN:Stochastic transmission model that integrates epidemiologic and clinical data on incidence and case fatality, daily viral load among survivors and nonsurvivors evaluated on the basis of the 2000-2001 outbreak in Uganda, and primary data on contacts of patients with Ebola in Liberia.

SETTING:Montserrado County, Liberia, July to September 2014.

MEASUREMENTS:Ebola incidence and case-fatality records from 2014 Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.

RESULTS:The average number of secondary infections generated throughout the entire infectious period of a single infected case, R, was estimated as 1.73 (95% CI, 1.66 to 1.83). There was substantial stratification between survivors (RSurvivors), for whom the estimate was 0.66 (CI, 0.10 to 1.69), and nonsurvivors (RNonsurvivors), for whom the estimate was 2.36 (CI, 1.72 to 2.80). The nonsurvivors had the highest risk for transmitting the virus later in the course of disease progression. Consequently, the isolation of 75% of infected individuals in critical condition within 4 days from symptom onset has a high chance of eliminating the disease.

LIMITATION:Projections are based on the initial dynamics of the epidemic, which may change as the outbreak and interventions evolve.

CONCLUSION:These results underscore the importance of isolating the most severely ill patients with Ebola within the first few days of their symptomatic phase.

  Abstract                 = {As an extension to the popular hidden Markov model (HMM),
 a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) allows the underlying
 stochastic process to be a semi-Markov chain. Each state
 has variable duration and a number of observations being
 produced while in the state. This makes it suitable for use
 in a wider range of applications. Its forward-backward
 algorithms can be used to estimate/update the model
 parameters, determine the predicted, filtered and smoothed
 probabilities, evaluate goodness of an observation sequence
 fitting to the model, and find the best state sequence of
 the underlying stochastic process. Since the HSMM was
 initially introduced in 1980 for machine recognition of
 speech, it has been applied in thirty scientific and
 engineering areas, such as speech recognition/synthesis,
 human activity recognition/prediction, handwriting
 recognition, functional MRI brain mapping, and network
 anomaly detection. There are about three hundred papers
 published in the literature. An overview of HSMMs is
 presented in this paper, including modelling, inference,
 estimation, implementation and applications. It first
 provides a unified description of various HSMMs and
 discusses the general issues behind them. The boundary
 conditions of HSMM are extended. Then the conventional
 models, including the explicit duration, variable
 transition, and residential time of HSMM, are discussed.
 Various duration distributions and observation models are
 presented. Finally, the paper draws an outline of the
 applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This article develops a theoretical framework of
 distributed representations to explore the representational
 properties in group problem solving. The basic principle of
 distributed representations is that the representational
 system of a group problem solving task is distributed
 across the representations of individuals, which together
 represent the abstract structure of the task. The framework
 was used to analyze the distributed representation of the
 Waitress and Orange task. From this analysis, an experiment
 was designed to examine group problem solving behaviors
 under different distributed representations. The experiment
 shows that (1) different distributed representations across
 two individuals produced dramatically different group
 problem solving behaviors even if they had the same
 abstract structure, and (2) two minds could be better than,
 not different from, or even worse than one mind, depending
 on how representations were distributed across the two
 minds. These results further support the interactionist
 view of group problem solving, which is that the
 interactions among individuals can produce group cognitive
 properties that can neither be reduced to nor be inferred
 from the cognitive properties of individuals.},

abstract = {The ongoing Ebola outbreak poses an alarming risk to the countries of West Africa and beyond. To assess the effectiveness of containment strategies, we developed a stochastic model of Ebola transmission between and within the general community, hospitals, and funerals, calibrated to incidence data from Liberia. We find that a combined approach of case isolation, contact-tracing with quarantine, and sanitary funeral practices must be implemented with utmost urgency in order to reverse the growth of the outbreak. As of 19 September, under status quo, our model predicts that the epidemic will continue to spread, generating a predicted 224 (134 to 358) daily cases by 1 December, 280 (184 to 441) by 15 December, and 348 (249 to 545) by 30 December.},
